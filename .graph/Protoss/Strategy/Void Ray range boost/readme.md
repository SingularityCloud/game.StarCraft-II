>The void ray functions as it did in Wings of Liberty, dealing more damage the longer it focuses on a single target. The void ray has a passive ability that increases its range as its damage increases, first by 1.5, then by 3 at maximum power. This makes the void ray an effective siege craft, able to attack ground units and structures safely from out of range of retaliation as at max range it outdistances all enemy defense turrets, and a very powerful anti-all flyer in general when in small groups.

>The damage and range boosts last for approximately four seconds after the current target is destroyed and both will remain at full power if they can quickly switch to another target, allowing a squad of them to mow through enemy troops, buildings, and special tough units like hybrid with surprising speed, arguably even faster than the Destroyer with its split beams.

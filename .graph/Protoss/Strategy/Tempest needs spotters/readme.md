>The resulting projectile, while unstable[5] and slow moving,[1] may be launched over great distances to soften up enemy forces or deal with defensive emplacements before protoss armies engage in battle.[5] In this regard, tempests are often situated behind protoss shock troops.
>**The matrix's range is so large that it actually exceeds the radius of the tempest's sensors. Thus, tempests sometimes need spotters to reveal faraway targets.[1]**
